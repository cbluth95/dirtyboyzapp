                          >Dirty Boyz Sanitation Service, Inc. opened in 2008 providing quality service and competitive pricing in the face of national competition. Dirty Boyz Sanitation Service knew that a small, local company could compete successfully and offer better personal service, attention and value to its customers. Eight years later, the company has grown from one trucks and 3 employee, to 4 trucks and 9 employees. We provide solid waste removal for government, commercial, and residential customers in Rawlins Wyoming.</div>
